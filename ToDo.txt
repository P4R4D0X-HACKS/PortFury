Here’s a detailed TODO list for each phase of PortFury development.

Roadmap for PortFury

Phase 1: Core Features

    SYN Scan (Stealth Scan)

        Implement TCP SYN scan using raw sockets or gopacket.

        Add a flag (-scan-type=syn) to switch between connect and SYN scans.

    UDP Scan

        Add support for scanning UDP ports.

        Use net.DialTimeout with udp as the network type.

    Rate Limiting

        Add a flag (-rate-limit=100) to control packets per second.

        Implement a token bucket or leaky bucket algorithm.

Phase 2: Advanced Scanning

    OS Fingerprinting

        Analyze TCP/IP stack behavior (e.g., TTL, window size) to guess the OS.

        Add a flag (-os-detection) to enable OS detection.

    Distributed Scanning

        Implement a master-worker architecture for distributed scans.

        Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis) for coordination.

    Asynchronous DNS Resolution

        Resolve domain names concurrently using goroutines and channels.

Phase 3: Usability Enhancements

    Interactive Mode

        Add an interactive shell using go-prompt or liner.

        Allow users to run commands like scan, set host, set ports, etc.

    Configuration File Support

        Add support for JSON/YAML configuration files.

        Allow users to save and load scan settings.

    Progress Bar

        Integrate a progress bar using mpb (Multi-Progress Bar).

        Show real-time progress during scans.

Phase 4: Advanced Output and Reporting

    HTML Report

        Generate an HTML report with scan results.

        Use Go templates to create a visually appealing report.

    Tool Integration

        Export results in formats compatible with Metasploit, Nessus, and Burp Suite.

        Add flags for CSV, XML, and JSON output.

    Real-Time Alerts

        Send alerts via email or Slack when specific ports or services are detected.

        Integrate with APIs like SendGrid and Slack Webhooks.

Phase 5: Security and Evasion

    Evasion Techniques

        Add options for packet fragmentation and random delays.

        Use gopacket to craft custom packets.

    Proxy Support

        Add support for SOCKS and HTTP proxies.

        Use libraries like golang.org/x/net/proxy.

    Encrypted Communication

        Encrypt traffic between the scanner and C2 server using TLS or AES.

Phase 6: AI/ML Integration

    Vulnerability Prediction

        Train a machine learning model to predict vulnerabilities based on open ports and banners.

        Integrate the model into the tool.

    Anomaly Detection

        Use clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means) to detect unusual patterns in scan results.

        Flag unexpected open ports or services.

Phase 7: Community and Collaboration

    Plugin System

        Allow users to write and share plugins for custom scans or features.

        Use Go’s plugin package or a scripting language like Lua.

    API for Automation

        Provide a REST or gRPC API for integrating PortFury into automated workflows.

        Use libraries like gin (REST) or grpc-go.

Phase 8: Documentation and Support

    Comprehensive Documentation

        Write detailed documentation, including tutorials, API references, and FAQs.

        Use tools like MkDocs or Docusaurus.

    Community Forum

        Create a forum or Discord server for users to ask questions and share tips.
